Fitness Exercise Classifier with Machine Learning
This Python project processes accelerometer and gyroscope data from wearable sensors to:

✅ Automatically classify barbell exercises (bench press, deadlift, overhead press, barbell row, squats)

✅ Count repetitions in real-time

✅ Visualize workout patterns for performance analysis

Built using Python and key libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib), the system:

Processes raw sensor data from MetaMotion devices

Identifies exercise patterns through time-series analysis

Uses machine learning (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks) for classification

Implements custom algorithms for repetition counting

Inspired by research from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, this project demonstrates how sensor data and ML can enhance fitness tracking. 

The techniques can also be adapted for other motion-based classification tasks.
